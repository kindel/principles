"""Every Further reading list carries at least one source beyond the blog.

The `blog` field in data/teaching/<company> renders as Further reading in
Porridge (kindel/porridge#46). Tig's posts stay, and each list also needs
one external source: the published principles, a shareholder letter, a book,
or an essay or talk by someone who shaped the practice. See SCHEMA.md.
Amazon is the classic 14. Any Company reuses those lists.
